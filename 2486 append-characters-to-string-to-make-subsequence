2486 append-characters-to-string-to-make-subsequence
You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.
Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.
A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"
Output: 4
Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
        SOLUTION
_________________________________________
class Solution {
    public int appendCharacters(String s, String t) {
        int sIndex=0,tIndex=0;
        int sLength=s.length(), tLength=t.length();
        while(sIndex<sLength && tIndex<tLength){
            if(s.charAt(sIndex)==t.charAt(tIndex)){
                tIndex++;
            }
            sIndex++;
        }
        return tLength-tIndex;
    }
}
