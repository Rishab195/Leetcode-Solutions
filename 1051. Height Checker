1051. Height Checker
A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

Example 1:

Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.
          SOLUTION
______________________________________
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        int[] expected=new int[heights.length];
        for(int i=0;i<heights.length;i++)
        {
            expected[i]=heights[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(expected);
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<heights.length;i++)
        {
            if(heights[i]!=expected[i])
            {
                count+=1;
            }
        }
        return count;
        
    }
}
