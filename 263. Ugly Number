263. Ugly Number
An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.
Example 1:

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
    SOLUTION
____________________________________
class Solution {
    public boolean isUgly(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
            return false; // Ugly numbers are positive integers
        }
        
        // Divide n by 2, 3, and 5 as much as possible
        int[] divisors = {2, 3, 5};
        for (int divisor : divisors) {
            while (n % divisor == 0) {
                n /= divisor;
            }
        }
        
        // If n becomes 1, it means it's an ugly number
        return n==1;
    }
}
