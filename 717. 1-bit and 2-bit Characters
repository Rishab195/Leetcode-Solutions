717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
We have two special characters:

The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.
Example 1:
Input: bits = [1,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character.
So the last character is one-bit character.
Example 2:

Input: bits = [1,1,1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character.
So the last character is not one-bit character.

class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int numbits=0;
        int n=bits.length;
        int i=0;
        while(i<n){
            if(bits[i]==1){
                i+=2;
                numbits=2;
            }
            else{
                i+=1;
                numbits=1;
            }
        }
        return numbits==1;
        
    }
}
